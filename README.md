# Climate Impact on Agriculture
This report presents an analysis of climate data to study the impact of climatic variables on crop yield across various countries and regions. The primary objective is to predict crop yield (MT/HA) based on environmental and agricultural factors using machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.   
## Skills:    
Python, Pandas, Sklearn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras, Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib), Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV), Machine Learning, Neural Networks.   
## Results:
