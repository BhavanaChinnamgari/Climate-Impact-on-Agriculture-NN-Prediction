# Climate Impact on Agriculture: NN Prediction

This report presents an analysis of climate data to study the impact of climatic variables on crop yield across various countries and regions. The primary objective is to predict crop yield (MT/HA) based on environmental and agricultural factors using machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains 10,000 records with 15 features. These features include:
•	Temporal features: Year
•	Geographical features: Country, Region
•	Agricultural features: Crop Type, Crop Yield (MT/HA), Irrigation Access (%), Pesticide Use (KG/HA), Fertilizer Use (KG/HA), Soil Health Index
•	Climate features: Average Temperature (°C), Total Precipitation (mm), CO2 Emissions (MT)
•	Other features: Extreme Weather Events, Adaptation Strategies, Economic Impact (Million USD)

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset was inspected for missing values, and no null entries were found. Standardization was performed on numeric features. Categorical variables were encoded where necessary to enable model training. Outliers and inconsistencies were addressed through exploratory analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA included the following visualizations:
1.	Boxplot of Crop Yield Distribution Across Countries: Showed variation in crop yield among countries.
2.	Correlation Heatmap of Numerical Features: Highlighted relationships between key variables, such as CO2 emissions and crop yield.
3.	Violin Plot of Crop Yield Distribution Across Countries: Visualized the distribution and density of crop yield values.
4.	Scatter Plot of CO2 Emissions vs Crop Yield: Analyzed the relationship between CO2 emissions and crop yield.
5.	Histogram of Average Temperature: Demonstrated the distribution of average temperatures across regions.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Models were trained using 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. The following machine learning models were implemented:
Random Forest Regressor - MAE: 0.726 | MSE: 0.741 | R²: 0.298
After hyperparameter tuning - MAE: 0.719 | MSE: 0.720 | R²: 0.318
Gradient Boosting Regressor - MAE: 0.722 | MSE: 0.723 | R²: 0.315
XGBoost Regressor - MAE: 0.731 | MSE: 0.748 | R²: 0.292
Neural Network Model - MAE: 0.783  | MSE: 0.892 | R²: 0.155

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model, after hyperparameter tuning, achieved the best performance with an R² of 0.318. The model successfully identified patterns in crop yield based on climate factors. Future improvements may include incorporating additional environmental features or using ensemble learning techniques.
